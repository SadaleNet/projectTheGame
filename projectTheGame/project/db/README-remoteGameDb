This folder contains a set of simple scripts for accessing the game database.

Pros:
	-Simple and general
	-Ceneterized storage(as opposed to storing file on local machine)
	-Password are hashed before being stored
	-Basic cheat protection. The User-Agent HTTP header must NOT be provided in order.
		^ The system also claim that the user will be banned if he have provided User-Agent header. However, there is no banning mechism at all. :P
Cons:
	-Most data are stored in the field 'data'. Database operations like ORDER BY cannot easily be used on the data.
	-Without HTTPS, password are transferred in plain text
	-No session management. The client is responsible for storing the username and password, which will be submitted in each query.

System requirement:
	-PHP with PDO that have sqlite driver installed
Setup:
	Before using the database, run init.php with a password. The password can be viewed by reading the content of init.php

Database Structure:
	Type	Field		Properties				Remarks
	TEXT	username	PRIMARY KEY
	TEXT	password	NOT NULL				hashed with sha1(concat(username, password))
	INTEGER	score		NOT NULL, DEFAULT(0)	is used for highscore board
	TEXT	data								serialized data for the user

Usage:
	-To access the database, just make HTTP requests(either GET or POST) to the corresponding pages along with query string, WITHOUT User-Agent header.
	-Except init.php, shared.php and manage.php, all .php files are intented to be used by the client.
	-Operations:
		[F]Create account:	http://.../register.php?username=whatever&password=passwd
		[F]Remove account:	http://.../deregister.php?username=whatever&password=passwd
		Validate Login:		http://.../login.php?username=whatever&password=passwd
		Store data:			http://.../store.php?username=whatever&password=passwd&content=SERIALIZED_DATA
		Store score:		http://.../store.php?username=whatever&password=passwd&score=1&content=1000
		[F]Fetch data:		http://.../fetch.php?username=whatever&password=passwd
		[F]Fetch score:		http://.../fetch.php?username=whatever&password=passwd&score=1
		[F]View highscores:	http://.../highscore.php
		Examples with [F] flag means the page returns content.
		For successful requests, a HTTP 200 will be responsed. For pages with [F] flag, response contents is also returned in the response body.
		If the request failed, a HTTP 400 will be responsed, along with error message in the response body.
	-The detailed usage of pages are documented in the php files.
